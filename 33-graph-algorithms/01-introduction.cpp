/*
Finite set of nodes(vertices) and edges.
Application: 
    -> Google maps
    -> Path finding algorithms
    -> Social networking websites.(Facebook edge-rank algorithms)
    -> Routing - server at different geolocation.

Terminologies and components:
    -> adjacent vertices ( O ---- O) adjacent node.
    -> degree (of node) is # of edges connected to that node.
        -> in-degree - incoming edges.
        -> out-degree - outgoing edges.
    -> path - way from one node to other.
    -> subgraph - some path of graph.
    -> connected graph - all nodes are connnected by atleast one edge (two connnected subgraph).
    -> connected component - graph in which all nodes are connected is one component all such different graph act a component.
    -> tree - graph without cycle (visit only one time).
    -> forest - collection of trees (all connected component).
    -> minimum spanning tree - weighted graph - all the nodes are covered with minimum weight - resulting tree is MST.
